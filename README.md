# skidom
Skidom is a Django app for helping skiers choose where to ski. 
It uses a web scraper to pull snow reports and the Google Maps API to provide driving distance and time estimates.
With one click, the user can compare multiple resorts, and spend less time planning a trip and more time on the slopes!

You can find an up-and-running version of Skidom here: https://skidom.herokuapp.com/.
